/*
  The solution below is a way to fix the percentages being off
  in iOs and Android devices and even browsers. It's also scalable
  because you can change the font-size of the stars and the width
  will adjust accordingly. This is the only way I found you could do
  unicode and CSS percentages for ratings.
*/

$(document).ready(function() {
    // Gets the span width of the filled-ratings span
    // this will be the same for each rating
    let star_rating_width = $('.fill-ratings span').width();
    // Sets the container of the ratings to span width
    // thus the percentages in mobile will never be wrong
    $('.star-ratings').width(star_rating_width);
});
